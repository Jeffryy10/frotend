# Blog Preview Card - Frontend Mentor

In this project, I built a blog preview card following the Frontend Mentor design.

During development, I had to **review Flexbox concepts**, as I had some difficulties manipulating elements inside a `div`.

Despite the challenges, it was very helpful to **refresh and reinforce my knowledge of Flexbox** and learn how to properly align and position elements within a container.

The project includes:

- Pure HTML and CSS
- Responsive design, adapted for both mobile and desktop
- Properly aligned images and classes
